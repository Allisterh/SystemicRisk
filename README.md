# Systemic Risk

I created this project for my Master of Science thesis at Universit√† Cattolica del Sacro Cuore (Milan, Italy) in 2015.
It can be used to calculate the following systemic risk indicators:
- CoVaR (Conditional Value-at-Risk) proposed by Adrian & Brunnermeier (2009);
- MES (Marginal Expected Shortfall) proposed by Acharya et al. (2010);
- Network Measures proposed by Billio et al. (2011);
- SRISK (Conditional Capital Shortfall Index) proposed by Brownlees & Engle (2014).
